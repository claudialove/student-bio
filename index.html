      <p>Agile web developer with strong communication and collaboration skills. Obsessed with design, quality, and logical algorithms. Passionate about using technology to make the web a more useful, efficient, organized and beautiful place. Human oriented in all things, I believe our presence on the web reflects our culture and humanity, as much as it does our business activity. With a decade in software development support as a quality assurance engineer, business and systems analyst, and scrum coach and scrum master, I am grateful for a journey that has brought me into development in a humble and accessible way.</p>
